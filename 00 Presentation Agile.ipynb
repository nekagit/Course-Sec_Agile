    "# Principles and Values of Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile is a framework used for developing and managing projects that emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, which outlines core values and principles guiding Agile methodologies. Below, we delve into the key values and principles that form the foundation of Agile practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Values of Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**\n",
    "   - Emphasizes human collaboration over rigid adherence to processes.\n",
    "   - Encourages open communication and collaboration among team members.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**\n",
    "   - Focuses on delivering functional software as the primary measure of progress.\n",
    "   - Advocates for documentation that is useful and necessary rather than exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**\n",
    "   - Prioritizes continuous collaboration and engagement with customers to ensure their needs are met.\n",
    "   - Encourages partnerships with customers rather than viewing interactions as formal contractual obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**\n",
    "   - Welcomes change and adapts to it throughout the project to deliver valuable outcomes.\n",
    "   - Promotes agility in the project by being flexible and responsive to changing circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles of Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customerâ€™s competitive advantage.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Simplicityâ€”the art of maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€”is essential.**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**"

    "### Kanban \n",
    "Atlassians / Jira / Tracking / Kanbanboard\n",

    "### Scrumban\n",
    "1. Kanban Board in Scrum\n",
    "The Scrum team can use a Kanban board to visualize the workflow and track the\n",
    "progress of work during each Sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board typically has columns for \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", and \"Done\", mirroring\n",
    "the Scrum workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work items (user stories, tasks, bugs, etc.) are represented as cards on the board\n",
    "and moved across the columns as they progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)\n",
    "Scrum teams can apply WIP limits to each column on the Kanban board to\n",
