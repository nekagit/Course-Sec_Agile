**Introduction to Agile Methodology**

Agile is a project management and product development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is characterized by iterative development, where solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Agile encourages adaptive planning, evolutionary development, and early delivery.

**Key Concepts in Agile**

1. **Iterations/Sprints**: Agile projects are divided into short cycles called iterations or sprints, usually lasting 1-4 weeks, to allow for rapid feedback and flexibility.
2. **Collaboration**: Features cross-functional teams that work closely together with stakeholders to deliver value.
3. **Customer Feedback**: Frequent feedback from customers ensures that the product aligns with their needs.
4. **Adaptive Planning**: Plans are continually refined based on new information and changing requirements.
